## LEGO Expressions

Using tasl effectively involves a different overall approach to schema design than other languages you may be used to. tasl doesn't have built-in concepts of optional properties, enums, class inheritance, etc. Instead, you can use tasl's little grammar of types to re-create them in exactly your own terms.

For example, you can't just call something "optional", but you _can_ construct a little expression that says "either this thing, or nothing". Working with tasl ends up feeling less like annotating a system diagram and more like playing with LEGOs.
