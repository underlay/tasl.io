# style guide

1. Be liberal with classes; make sure your properties are really properties
2. Don't over-generalize: focus on modeling your specific context, not the whole world!
3. Prefer the `xsd` datatypes
4. Minimize `xsd:string` - use enums or URIs whenever you can
5. Minimize `xsd:boolean` - use enums whenever you can
6. Use `JSON` when you need to, but only when you really need to
7. Minimize linked lists
